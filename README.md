## Challenges
* Everything
* Received a good lesson in declaring global variables
* Learned what .split does which staved me from creating lengthy char arrays
* Could not get .push to work for the allChar variable so I tried the .concat method after much research
* The for loop gave me the most heartache. I was using the wrong variable (passwordText) instead of password for the element position.
